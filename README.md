## Summary
There is a huge number of employees ready for retirement with the majority being in senior level positions. This give us a great opportunity to try and retain senior employees as part time to help train new staff and lessen the burden of such a huge retirement ready group. Another good thing to focus on with the senior level employees is having them create guides that can be utilized by new staff to help train them for best practices and help keep retention of employees high and revenues up.
